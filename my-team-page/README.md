### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

Simple HTML and CSS.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## Thoughts on Completion

Main thing here was to know about `writing-mode` and `:nth-of-type` selector. Apart from that there were some accessibility concerns which I hopefully think I fixed by using proper semantic HTML.
